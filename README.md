## Corporations

This plugin adds three new corporations so far: Greenrock Shipyard Ltd. and Sirius Pyrotechnics Corporation. The first is a legitimate company based on Greenrock that in no way endorses or supports pirates. The second, however, is a complete joke. They run a small shipyard on Relic where they produce the Grackle, a thoroughly insane ship. Finally, there is an unnamed engineering firm that built the Woodchip.

Please suggest new ships or report bugs in the issues here or on the Endless Sky Discord server.
